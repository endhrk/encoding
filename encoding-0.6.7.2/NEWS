Changes from 0.6.5 to 0.6.7
---------------------------

* Skipped version 0.6.6 due to rogue upload on Hackage
* GHC-7 and HaXml-1.22 compatibility
* add -systemEncoding flag for Windows builds

Changes from 0.6.4 to 0.6.5
---------------------------

* Make package work with >=base-4.3.0.0 and mtl-2

Changes from 0.6.3 to 0.6.4
---------------------------

* Throw an error when encoding non-ascii chars with ascii
* Fix compilation with mtl-2

Changes from 0.6.2 to 0.6.3
---------------------------

* Use new QuickCheck version 2 for tests
* Fixed UTF16 encoding range

Changes from 0.6.0 to 0.6.1
---------------------------

* Support for many MSDOS codepages
* Show instance for DynEncoding
* More IO functions
* Fancy translation tables for the documentation of auto-generated modules

Changes from 0.5.2 to 0.6.0
---------------------------

* Moved from TemplateHaskell to a custom pre-processor for code-generation.
  This is necessary because:
  - TemplateHaskell is really slow for large data structures
  - TemplateHaskell doesn't yet support the MagicHash extension that is useful for the library
* Use efficient, static data structures for encoding/decoding
* Fixed bug in UTF-8 that could call 'chr' with bad arguments

Changes from 0.5 to 0.5.2
-------------------------

* Export function encodingFromStringExplicit

Changes from 0.4 to 0.5
-----------------------

* Complete rewrite of the Encoding class to allow for
  - On-the-fly changing of the encoding while en-/decoding
  - Ability to en-/decode from/to any data structure
* A general module to help specify encodings based on ISO 2022
* New encodings:
  - JIS X 0201
  - JIS X 0208
  - ISO 2022-JP
* More test cases

Changes from 0.3 to 0.4
-----------------------

* A new, strict UTF-8 decoder
* Minor bugs fixed in UTF-16 and BootString
* Test cases for UTF-8, UTF-16 and BootString
* Added KOI8U encoding

Changes from 0.2 to 0.3
-----------------------

* Converted to new cabal interface
* Support for GHC 6.8
* Support for new bytestring interface

Changes from 0.1 to 0.2
-----------------------

* Implemented GB18030 encoding
